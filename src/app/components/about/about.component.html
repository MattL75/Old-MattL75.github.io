                <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm passionate about everything remotely related to computers and spend most of my time
                    working on personal projects. I love sitting down and creating with some nice music playing in the
                    background. That's my kind of Friday night.</p>

                <p>My interests include reading, philosophy, history, strategy games and hockey.</p>

                <p>I will be graduating Concordia University in the Summer of 2019.</p>

                <p>By the way - my actual name is Mathieu, but only my mother is allowed to call me that.</p>
